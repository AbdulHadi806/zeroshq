# README: Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment and Running the Script

This guide will walk you through the process of cloning the repository, setting up a virtual environment (venv), installing dependencies, and running the script.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Installed**  
   Ensure Python 3.6 or later is installed on your system.  
   Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) if not already installed.

---

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Clone the Repository
Use the following command to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```
Replace `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git` with the actual repository URL.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning, navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd your-repo-name
```
Replace `your-repo-name` with the name of the cloned repository.

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment
Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
This creates a new directory named `venv` in the current folder. It will contain isolated Python binaries and a local package manager (`pip`).

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment
- **Windows**:
  ```cmd
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Linux/Mac**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

You should see the virtual environment name (`venv`) in the command line prompt, indicating it's active.

### 5. Install Dependencies
If the repository contains a `requirements.txt` file, use the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Run the Script
Run the Python file using:
```bash
python main.py
```

Replace `main.py` with the name of the main script file in the repository.

---

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment
After running the script, deactivate the virtual environment using:
```bash
deactivate
```

Now youâ€™re ready to clone, set up, and run your Python project! ðŸŽ‰
